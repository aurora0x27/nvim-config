YET ANOTHER NVIM CONFIG

This is my new nvim config, almost rewritten all by hand.

After using AstroNvim for about three month, I want to maintain
a configuration by my self due to the complexity of AstroNvim.

**Based on the repository: kickstart.nvim (url:https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)**

**THIS REPOSITORY IS STILL IN DEVELOPPING**

**IT WILL BE ADDED TO MY DOTFILES REPOSITORY WHEN IT SETTLES DOWN**
