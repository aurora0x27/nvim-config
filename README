YET ANOTHER NVIM CONFIG

This is my new nvim config, almost rewritten all by hand.

After using AstroNvim for about three month, I want to maintain
a configuration by my self due to the complexity of AstroNvim.

THIS REPOSITORY IS STILL IN DEVELOPPING

IT WILL BE ADDED TO MY DOTFILES REPOSITORY WHEN IT SETTLES DOWN
